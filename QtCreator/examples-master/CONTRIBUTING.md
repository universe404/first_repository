# How to contribute to VLC-Qt Examples

## Adding new examples

New examples are always welcome. Here are some guidelines for new submissions:

- Add descriptive README file, where you state supported Qt versions (4 and/or 5),
  supported build system (CMake, qmake, other) and presented VLC-Qt features.
- Please define the license of your example. It may be public domain or licensed
  using any license in compliance with VLC-Qt licensing. 
- The example **must** be cross-platform if not otherwise stated.
- Try to make it simple and well documented.


## Updating existing examples

Existing examples may need update from time to time to add support for new
VLC-Qt features, new compilers, build systems, Qt/VLC versions etc.

Feel free to open a pull request with improvements. Note that you should comply
with the example license and use similar coding style. A completely new feature
may be better presented in a new example and not in existing ones.
